        <div class="card-title">Entering Scores</div>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p>When you enter an expected dance all scores will show as 0 awiting for you to enter the scores provided by the judges.</p>
            <p>Judges may have categories that only 1 judge scores or they may have scores that multiple judges score (e.g. buzz and presentations). You will need to take the average of the scores where the category is split accrosss the judges. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>e.g. Judge 1 = 15, Judge 2 = 13, Average is 14</li>
                <li>e.g. Judge 1 = 10, Judge 2 = 9, Average is 9.5</li>
                <li>e.g. Judge 1 = 10, Judge 2 = 10, Average is 10 </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Judges should be providing marks in whole numbers for clarity to the competitors and ease of reading and processing on the score sheets.</p>
            <p>To enter the scores simply click in the relevant field and enter the score calculated.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/walkthrough/dance-score-entry.png"/>
            <p>Once you have completed all the categories for the dance click "Send Scores"" at the bottom of the page.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/walkthrough/dance-score-submit.png"/>
            <p>You will be pushed through to the upload photos slide and notified of the scores being sucessfully uploaded.</p>

        <div class="card-title">Photographing Scoresheets</div>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p>The teams are interested in the judges comments as soon as they can get them. To support this you can take photos of the score sheets and upload them.</p>
            <p>To do this simply click on the take photo button this will bring up the device camera. (Your device may ask you for permission to do this)</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/walkthrough/take-photo.png"/>
            <p>From the camera take a photo and confirm the photo taken is ok (the behaviour may vary dependant on our device)</p>
            <p>You will be returned to the photo screen and you taken photograph will display</p>
            <p>After a short period of time you will be notified that the photo has been successfully uploaded and the photo will refresh with a resized verion from the uploaded photograph.</p>
            <p>Proceed to take the photograph of the next score sheet by repeating the process</p>
            <p>Once complete you will have entered all the information required for that dance</p>
            <p>Please note: Although it is desireable to have photos of the score sheets it is not necessary. If you have a poor connection please use your judgement as to whether you are able to provide photographs. If the upload is taking to long for 2 sheets consider doing a photo of both sheets in 1 photo.</p>

        <div class="card-title">Editing Dances</div>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p>You are able to change the scored of a dance until the dance is marked as checked. This is to allow you to correct any errors or make changes.</p>
            <p>Changes may occour during the first few dances of day where a judge realises that they have pitched the first or second dance too high or too low.</p>
            <p>You can feel free to make changes in these scenarios so long as you have both the score sheets so that the scores and the sheets both match.</p>
            <p>Once the scores have been checked then no further edits are possible.</p>
